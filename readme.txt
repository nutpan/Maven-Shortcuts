This is just a collection maven shortcut batch files. I am trying to create shortcuts for mostly used maven commands.

Short Cuts

mvnci - mvn clean install
mvnciwt - mvn clean install with out tests
mvnt - mvn test
mvnt %1 - mvn test on single test file (eg : mvnt MyTest)
mvnee - mvn eclipse:eclipse

All the shortcuts will echo the actual mvn command before execute.
